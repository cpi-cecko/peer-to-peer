What is a P2P System?
=====================

A system is considered to be P2P if every node in it provides services as well
as uses services provided by other nodes.

A system where most nodes only act as clients cannot be considered P2P.
However, a system could be P2P if there are some specialized nodes which only
act as a server or a client, or provide other kinds of resources.

Having a central enrollment server in a P2P system, doesn't make the system
non-P2P. Having a centralized torrent-tracker in a file-sharing P2P system
doesn't make it non-P2P.

However, Grid computing systems, by this definition, aren't P2P. SETI@home and
MapReduce also can't be considered P2P systems.

Types of P2P Systems
====================

P2P systems for data distribution. These are systems like BitTorrent, Napster,
Gnutella.

P2P systems for distributed computing. We'll relax the definition. SETI@home,
genome@Home.

P2P systems for collaboration. Tox, Skype, P2PSIP, P2P rendezveous systems.
