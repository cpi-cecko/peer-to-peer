Agenda
1. Definition of a P2P system. Terminology. Case studies.
2. Simple, LAN-based, multicast, UDP, P2P chat.
3. Making the chat global. Centralized solution.
4. Exploring decentralized solutions. Going through NATs.
   Flooding broadcast of queries.
5. Routing model-based chat.
6. DHT-based chat.
7. Streaming video.
8. Editing documents.
9. Sharing big files and BitTorrent.
10. Ad-hoc sharing of big files.
11. Sharing small files; gitp2p.
12. Distributed computing in P2P systems.
13. Disaster-based P2P systems.

Protocols

DHT - Chord, CAN, Tapestry, Pastry
Gossip protocol

===

Examples:
- P2PSIP
- Gnutella
- Napster
- Kademlia
- BitTorrent
- Tox
- Skype
- WoW updates
- Octoshape
- ZebraNet (kind-of)
- P2P botnets, SETI@home, MapReduce (kind-of)
- JXTA
- gitp2p

Functions:
  - Enrollment
  - Discovery
  -- Data indexing (finding stored data)
  -- Data storage
  -- Computation
  -- Message transport

Taxonomy:
- Central, Local, Distributed
- Semantic and Semantic-free indexes

Content distribution:
- Encrypted content
- Whole content, part of it, linear combination of the content

A pure P2P system would still be considered pure even if it had centralized
enrollment and peer discovery services.
