. Definition of a P2P system

. Figuring out what problem the peer-to-peer system will solve
    . File Sharing
        -- big files (BitTorrent)
        -- small files (peer-to-peer git hosting)
    . Distributed Computing
    . Collaboration

. Architectures
    . Purely Decentralized
    . Hybrid

. Discovery
    . Centralized Indexes
    . Flooding Broadcast of Queries
    . Routing Model
    . DHT

. Network Structure

. Challanges
    . Security
    . Reliability
    . Flexibility
    . Load Balancing
    . Incentives
    . Energy-aware P2P protocols [006]

Examples:
- P2PSIP
- Gnutella
- Napster
- Kademlia
- BitTorrent
- Skype
- WoW updates
- Octoshape
- ZebraNet (kind-of)
- P2P botnets, SETI@home, MapReduce (kind-of)
- JXTA
- gitp2p

Functions:
  - Enrollment
  - Discovery
  -- Data indexing (finding stored data)
  -- Data storage
  -- Computation
  -- Message transport

Taxonomy:
- Central, Local, Distributed
- Semantic and Semantic-free indexes

Content distribution:
- Encrypted content
- Whole content, part of it, linear combination of the content

A pure P2P system would still be considered pure even if it had centralized
enrollment and peer discovery services.
